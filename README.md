# MOO-ORG

This repository contains organization-level community and configuration files for the MOO-ORG GitHub organization. It serves as the canonical place for templates, guidance, and links to resources that apply across projects within the organization.

## Purpose

Provide organization-wide documentation, templates, and governance pointers so maintainers and contributors can find common resources and follow consistent practices.

## What you'll find here

- ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ — templates used across repositories
- CONTRIBUTING.md — organization-level contributing guidance (if present)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md — expected behavior and community standards (if present)
- ISSUE and PR templates, dependabot, and other org-level configuration

If a file listed above is not present yet, it may be added as the organization standard is developed.

## How to use these templates

- Repositories in the organization can adopt these templates by referencing them or copying them into their repo root.
- Admins can configure default templates at the organization level so new issues and PRs use these defaults.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for organization-wide templates or policies, open an issue in this repository and propose changes. For changes that affect many projects, please discuss them first so maintainers can agree on the approach.

## Security

To report security issues, please use the repository's issue tracker and mark the issue as private if it contains sensitive details, or follow the security reporting guidance in SECURITY.md (if present).

## License

Unless otherwise specified, content in this repository follows the MIT License. See LICENSE for details if available.
