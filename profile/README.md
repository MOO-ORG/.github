  (•ᴥ•)  Hi there! — This repo holds organization-wide templates, guidance,
  / >🌷  and tiny bits of magic to help projects follow the same friendly style.

---

## ✨ What you'll find here
- ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ & PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ — ✍️ ready-made templates
- CONTRIBUTING.md — How to contribute with kindness ❤️
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md — Be excellent to each other
- SECURITY.md — Secure reporting guidance
