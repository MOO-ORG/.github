## 👋 Who We Are

We're a bunch of students who love to learn, build, and share. MOO-ORG is our little GitHub space where we collect fun projects, course materials, and programming experiments — mostly for BRAC University courses, but really for anyone who enjoys tinkering with code.

---

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- 🧪 **Course Repositories** — Java, Data Structures, OOP, and more
- 🎓 **Assignments & Notes** — Helpful for revision or self-study
- 🛠️ **Mini Projects** — Just for fun or practice
- 📚 **Learning Resources** — Things we found useful and want to share

---

## 💡 Why We Do This

Because learning is better together. We believe in open sharing, helping each other out, and keeping things simple and accessible. No pressure, no perfection — just progress.
